# StaticSiteBP
My boilerplate for a Jekyll/Gulp Static Website

## Includes:
- Templating via Jekyll Static Site Generator
- Gulp for sass/js compiling
- BrowserSync for hot reload

## Installation:
This repo is mainly for my own personal use, but if you'd like to have this dance, be my guest, be my guest, made of real gorilla chest.

1. Install [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) (May require updating ruby or installing gems. Jekyll docs should cover it.)
2. Install Node Version 8.1
3. `git clone https://github.com/BillyH80/StaticSiteBP.git`
4. `npm install`
5. `gulp`
